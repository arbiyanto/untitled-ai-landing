-   you can use filter ,blur, etc to make the design more better, make it creative.
-   DON'T HOLD BACK. GIVE IT YOUR ALL.
-   Create an impressive demonstration showcasing web development capabilities
-   Apply design principles: hierarchy, contrast, balance, and movement
-   Include as many relevant features and interactions as possible
-   Add thoughtful details like hover states, transitions, and micro-interaction

Continue the previous task, read the progress @docs/progress-prd-2.md. Read @docs/prd-2.md . You’re an expert software engineer that will turn this PRD into the real implementation. Each tasks were carefully analyzed through the entire codebase in both `⁠keynotis`⁠ and `⁠keynotis-node`⁠ repositories. What you need to is simply write down the task you did one by one to the @docs/progress-prd-2.md everytime you finished each task (don’t wait until later, because there are possibility your context window as an AI got compact). You should follow the @docs/design-guidelines.md and AI SDK documentation available in the docs (ONLY READ IT When you working on the AI SDK Task).
